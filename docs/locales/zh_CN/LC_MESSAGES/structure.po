msgid "Configure the Table of Contents"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This page covers some of the options you have available to control your "
"book's behavior via the Table of Contents."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configure all entries in the TOC"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To configure options for all entries of your TOC, use the `defaults:` "
"configuration at the root of your Table of Contents. This configuration "
"will be applied to every list of chapters or sections within your book."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Configure a single top-level set of chapters/sections"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're only using a single list of chapters, and not organizing them "
"into parts, you can configure each with the `options:` key."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configure an individual Part"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are organizing your book into **parts** (groups of chapters), you "
"can configure each set of chapters separately by providing `key: value` "
"pairs alongside each `part` entry, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this case, the `numbered:` option would *only apply to Part 1*, and "
"not Part 2. If you would like numbering across your project you will need"
" to add `numbered: true` to all `parts`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Currently there is no global setting to enable `numbered: true` across "
"all parts."
msgstr ""

msgid "You cannot use"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"as sphinx will issue warnings due to `numbered` flag being set for "
"substrees. It also causes unexpected output."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add captions to Parts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To add a caption to a Part (so that it shows up in the sidebar, for "
"example) use the `caption:` option like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Specify alternate titles"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you'd like to specify an alternate title from the one defined within a"
" file, you may do so with the `title:` key. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this only applies to the sidebar in the table of contents, it "
"does not change the actual chapter/section title."
msgstr ""

msgid "Number your chapters and sections"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can automatically add numbers to each chapter of your book. To add "
"numbers to **all chapters of your book**, add the `numbered: true` flag "
"to your book's defaults, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Numbers will follow a hierarchy according to the structure defined in "
"your `_toc.yml` file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Continuous numbering is now the default behavior from `jupyter-"
"book>=0.11.2`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, chapter numbering will be continuous between parts (i.e. they"
" will not re-start each section at `1.` each time) using an extension "
"called [sphinx-multitoc-numbering](https://github.com/executablebooks"
"/sphinx-multitoc-numbering)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To **restart chapter numbering between parts**, use the following setting"
" in your `_config.yml` file:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This was the **default behaviour** prior to `jupyter-book<0.11.2`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Limit the depth of numbering"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you'd like to limit the depth of numbering, use an **integer** for the"
" `numbered` flag. This will be the depth of sub-sections to continue "
"numbering. For example, `numbered: 3`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you'd like to number **subsets of chapters**, group them into parts "
"and apply the `numbered: true` flag to the parts whose chapters you wish "
"to be numbered."
msgstr ""

msgid "A few caveats about numbering"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Jupyter Book relies on {term}`Sphinx` to apply section numbering, and "
"this has a few quirks to it. Here are a few gotchas:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Numbering applies to _sections_ of your page**. Note that when you add "
"numbering to a section, it will add numbers to *each header in a file*. "
"This means that if you have headers in a top-level section, then its "
"headers will become numbered as sub-sections, and any other _files_ "
"underneath it will begin as third-level children. See [](toc/structure) "
"for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "jupyter-book < 0.11.2"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Numbering resets across parts**. If you specify groups of sections via "
"`- part:` entries, then numbering will restart between them. That means "
"if you have two `- part:` entries with 2 pages each, you will have two "
"sets of `1.` and `2.` sections, one for each part."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add a table of contents to a page's content"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you'd like to add a table of contents for the sub-sections of a page "
"*within the page content* (in-line with the content on the page), you may"
" do so by using the `{tableofcontents}` directive. You can use it like "
"so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the source of [the content types page](../file-types/index.md) for an"
" example."
msgstr ""

msgid "Control the depth of the displayed Table of Contents"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To control the maximum depth of the Table of Contents that you insert, "
"use the `maxdepth:` option in your `_toc.yml` file. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Exclude pages from your build"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Jupyter Book will build all content files that are found in "
"your book's folder, even if they are not specified in `_toc.yml` (and "
"will raise a warning if it finds a file that isn't listed there)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you'd like Jupyter Book to skip a file entirely, you can do so with "
"the following configuration in `_config.yml`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any files that match the patterns described there will be excluded from "
"the build. If you'd like to exclude files from being *executed* but still"
" wish for them to be built by Jupyter Book, see [](execute/exclude)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disable building files that aren't in the Table of Contents"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Jupyter Book will build all files that are in your book's "
"folder, regardless of whether they are specified in the Table of "
"Contents. To disable this behavior and *only* build files that are "
"specified in the TOC, use the following pattern in `_config.yml`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that files that are in *hidden folders* (e.g. in `.github` or "
"`.venv`) will still be built even if they are not specified in the TOC. "
"You should exclude these files explicitly."
msgstr ""

msgid "How headers and sections map onto to book structure"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Jupyter Book uses the {term}`Sphinx` documentation engine under the hood,"
" which represents the structure of your book in a particular way. "
"Different choices for the structure of `_toc.yml` and the header "
"structures within your pages will result in different outcomes for your "
"overall book structure. Here are some general tips and best-practices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is particularly important when you [number your book's "
"sections](toc/numbering) or when you [build a PDF of your book through "
"Latex](pdf:latex)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Chapters are at the top of your book hierarchy**. The top level of your"
" `_toc.yml` contains a list of chapters. The title of each file will be "
"the chapter's title."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Headers map onto sections**. Jupyter Book interprets your book as a "
"collection of sections, and decides how those sections should be nested "
"according to the hierarchy of `_toc.yml` and the hierarchy of headers in "
"a page. Within a file, the first `## ` header it discovers will define "
"the top-most section in the file, and any subsequent `### ` headers "
"underneath will become sub-sections (until another `## ` section is "
"encountered). This behavior is a bit different if the page is *nested* "
"under another (see below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Nested files define sections _underneath_ the last section of their "
"parent**. If you specify sections that are *nested* under a file (with "
"the `sections:` key) then those sections will begin *underneath* the last"
" headers of the parent page."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, if your `_toc.yml` file looks like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then the sections of `chapter1section` will begin **under** the sections "
"of `chapter1`. Any headers in `chapter1section` will be treated as a "
"\"next-header-deeper\" section in `chapter1`."
msgstr ""

msgid "In other words, if `chapter1` and `chapter1section` look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`chapter1.md`"
msgstr ""

msgid "`chapter1section.md`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then your book will treat them like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "However, if `chapter1.md` had an extra third-level header, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then your book would treat them like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep this in mind when you design the structure of your files."
msgstr ""

msgid "A good rule of thumb is to take one of these two approaches:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**don't put headers in your introduction pages**. This is true for both "
"the book's introduction, as well as for any chapter introductions. "
"Instead, leave the headers to pages that have more content in them, and "
"use **bolded text** where you would otherwise use headers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Use a flat list of files instead of nested files**. This way the "
"section hierarchy is defined only in a single file within each section. "
"However, this means you will have longer files in general."
msgstr ""
