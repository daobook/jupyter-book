msgid "Sphinx usage and customization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Jupyter Book uses [the Sphinx documentation engine](https://sphinx-"
"doc.org) to build a rich document model from your source files. This also"
" allows for some extra customization under the hood. This chapter covers "
"a few ways to customize Sphinx or to directly use it in building your "
"book."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Manually customizing Sphinx is considered **advanced usage** - it is "
"highly recommended that you read the [Sphinx documentation](https"
"://sphinx-doc.org)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Convert your Jupyter Book into a Sphinx website"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to *convert* a Jupyter Book into a structure that is "
"directly compatible with Sphinx. This allows you to directly build the "
"book with Sphinx commands, like `sphinx-build`. It is useful if you wish "
"to use services that directly support Sphinx builds, like "
"[ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org), or if you wish to use sphinx-"
"specific commands like [`sphinx-"
"autobuild`](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The only file that Sphinx requires to build a Jupyter Book is `conf.py`. "
"To generate one from your book's `_config.yml` file, run the following "
"command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "See [](/reference/cli.md) for more usage information of this command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will use your `_config.yml` file along with your `_toc.yml` file to "
"generate the appropriate `conf.py`. After doing so, you can build your "
"book with the standard Sphinx build commands. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Don't manually edit your `conf.py` file. Instead, update your "
"`_config.yml` file and re-run `jupyter-book config sphinx` to make sure "
"the two configuration files stay in-sync. Alternatively, [automate this "
"with a pre-commit hook](sphinx:convert:pre-commit)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automate conversion with a pre-commit hook"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is a useful tool for automating "
"common tasks with a git repository. It will automatically run commands "
"when you make a commit in `git`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Follow these steps to use a `pre-commit` hook that converts your Jupyter "
"Book into a Sphinx site, to ensure that they remain in-sync:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Install `pre-commit`. Follow the [pre-commit install instructions](https"
"://pre-commit.com/#install)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. This is the file that tells "
"`pre-commit` which hooks to install as a part of your project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See [the pre-commit instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-"
"configyaml---hooks) for more information on this file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add the _Jupyter Book to Sphinx_ conversion hook by adding the following "
"config to `pre-commit-config.yaml`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Where `path/to/book` is the path to your book's source files, relative to"
" the repository root."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initialize `pre-commit` for your repository:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This will install the pre-commit hook that you've configed above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make a commit to your repository, and confirm that the `jupyter-book "
"config sphinx` command is automatically run."
