msgid "Configuration reference"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can configure Jupyter Book with a **YAML configuration file "
"(`_config.yml`)**. This file controls a number of options and feature "
"flags."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This page is a reference for the `_config.yml` structure along with "
"default values for each option. For information about using and "
"configuring specific features, see the **Topic Guides**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"YAML can be tricky when it comes to how it treats certain kinds of "
"values. For example, when using strings in YAML it is usually fine to "
"omit quotes around them. However, there are certain values that will be "
"*converted* to boolean values if they do not have strings around them. "
"For example, `false`, `true`, `off`, etc. In addition, pure numbers will "
"be converted to `float` or `int` unless you put strings around them."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration defaults"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Below is the full default configuration file. Anything you set in your "
"own `_config.yml` will be merged into these defaults before they are used"
" to configure the build."
msgstr ""

msgid "Structure the Table of Contents"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your book's structure is determined by a **Table of Contents**. This is a"
" YAML file (called `_toc.yml`) that defines a structure that Jupyter Book"
" uses to create the order and nesting of pages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Migrate to the new Table of Contents structure"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A new Table of Contents structure was introduced in `v0.11`. To migrate "
"your old TOC structure to the new structure, you have a few options:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Manually migrate your TOC**. See [this blog "
"post](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/updates/2021-06-18-update-"
"toc.html) for one example migration from an old TOC structure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Use the migration tool**. This automatically generates a new TOC from "
"your old one, though may alter the formatting slightly. To do so, use the"
" following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Structure of a Book"
msgstr ""

msgid "The table of contents is broadly organized like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a brief explanation of each key:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`format:`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Defines the structure of this Table of Contents (e.g., how to interpret "
"the key names). `jb-book` tells Jupyter Book to expect `chapters` and "
"`parts` terminology (see below for details)."
msgstr ""

msgid "`root:`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first page of your book (aka, the \"root page\"). It is the landing "
"page for the HTML of your book."
msgstr ""

msgid "`chapters:`"
msgstr ""

msgid "A list of entries, each of which maps onto **chapters** of your book."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use chapter sub-sections"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may optionally split a chapter across multiple files (each making up "
"a **section** of the chapter). To do so, use the `sections:` "
"configuration, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's a brief explanation of `sections:`"
msgstr ""

msgid "`sections:`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A list of entries that define **sub-sections** of a chapter. This is "
"useful if you'd like to split a chapter across multiple pages. See "
"[](toc/structure) for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use parts to organize chapters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may optionally organize your chapters into **parts**, by using the "
"`parts:` key like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's a brief explanation of `parts:`"
msgstr ""

msgid "`parts:`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A list of entries, each of which defines a chapter. This is useful if "
"you'd like to use different groups of chapters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Structure of an Article"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can build an **article** (e.g., a single page) rather than an entire "
"book. You can build outputs for an article from a single source file, or "
"split it up across multiple files (similar to how you'd structure a "
"book)."
msgstr ""

msgid "This section contains more information about how to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid "Work in progress"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Article building functionality for Jupyter Book is still under design and"
" development. This functionality may change over time! If you have ideas,"
" suggestions, or would like to help out, please [see the contributing "
"guide](../contribute/intro.md)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Build an article from a single file"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can generate a standalone HTML file for a single page of the Jupyter "
"Book using the `jupyter-book` command, and pointing it to a **single "
"file** instead of a book's directory:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will build the file as usual, and place it in an output folder "
"called `_build/_page/html/<mypage>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the file is in a subdirectory relative to the `_build` folder, the "
"HTML will be in a `_build/_page/html/<subdirectory-mypage>` folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your page will be called `mypage.html`. This will work for any [content "
"source file](../file-types/index.md) that is supported by Jupyter Book."
msgstr ""

msgid "Build an article from multiple files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may also split an article across multiple input files (e.g., if you'd"
" like to store sections separately). To do so, use the `format: jb-"
"article` option in your `_toc.yml` file."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The primary difference is that the `jb-book` format uses `parts:` and "
"`chapters:` syntax, while the `jb-article` format uses `sections:` syntax"
" alone."
msgstr ""

msgid "Types of content entries"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are several types of entries that you may provide in order to point"
" to specific types of content. Here is a quick overview:"
msgstr ""

msgid "`file:`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A path that points to a local text file, which defines the content of "
"this entry (the chapter, section, or sub-section). These paths should be "
"relative to your `_toc.yml` file."
msgstr ""

msgid "`glob:`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A [glob-like pattern](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) that "
"can be used to match against **multiple local files**. Each of these "
"files will be collected and inserted into your content, in the order that"
" `glob` discovers them."
msgstr ""

msgid "`url:`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An external link to a website (starting with `http` or `https`). This "
"will be inserted into your book's Table of Contents, though it will not "
"affect your book's structure (like numbering)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a `title:` entry is provided its text is used instead of the full "
"URL."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is an example to show all three types:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Generate a Table of Contents from content files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use `jupyter-book` to *generate* a table of contents file from "
"your book using the filenames of your book's content. To do so, run the "
"following command"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Jupyter Book will search `mybookpath/` for any [content files](../file-"
"types/index.md) and create a `_toc.yml` file out of them. There are a few"
" considerations to keep in mind:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each sub-folder must have at least one content file inside it"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ordering of files in `_toc.yml` will depend on the alphanumeric order"
" of the filenames (e.g., `folder_01` comes before `folder_02`, and "
"`apage` comes before `b_page`)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there is a file called `index.md` in any folder, it will be listed "
"first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may also **generate navigation bar *titles* from each file of your "
"book**. If you do so, note that if the file name begins with "
"`<integer>_filename.md`, then the `<integer>` part will be removed before"
" it is inserted into `_toc.yml`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition, you have a few extra options for controlling how the "
"`_toc.yml` file is generated."
msgstr ""
