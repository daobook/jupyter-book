msgid ""
"**Table of Contents**. The Table of Contents infrastructure is now "
"handled by the Sphinx extension [`sphinx-external-"
"toc`](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-external-toc). This comes"
" with a more structured format for `_toc.yaml` through the introduction "
"of `jb-article` and `jb-book` formats. In order to convert your book's "
"TOC to the new format, you may run the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This command includes `-o` which will update your current `_toc.yml` file"
" to work with the latest `jupyter-book` release."

msgid ""
"See the [Table of Contents "
"documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/toc.html) for more "
"information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `_toc.yml` file now has support to use `glob` to add files based on a"
" pattern to the table of contents. This is added using the `glob` key "
"where you would usually specify a `file` or `url`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"this matches any documents that start with `other` that are contained in "
