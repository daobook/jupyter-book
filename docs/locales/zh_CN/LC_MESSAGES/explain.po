msgid "The Jupyter Book toolchain and components"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Jupyter Book is a wrapper around a collection of tools in the Python "
"ecosystem that make it easier to publish computational documents. Here "
"are a few key pieces:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It uses {term}`the MyST Markdown language<MyST>` in Markdown and notebook"
" documents. This allows users to write rich, publication-quality markup "
"in their documents."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It uses {term}`the MyST-NB package<MyST-NB>` to parse and read-in "
"notebooks so they are built into your book."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It uses {term}`the Sphinx documentation engine<Sphinx>` to build outputs "
"from your book's content."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It uses a slightly modified version of the [PyData Sphinx theme](https"
"://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for beautiful HTML "
"output."
msgstr ""

msgid "It uses a collection of Sphinx plugins and tools to add new functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more information about the project behind many of these tools, see "
"[The Executable Book Project](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/) "
"documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid "How Jupyter Book and Sphinx relate to one another"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Jupyter Book utilizes [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) "
"heavily under the hood. In fact, Jupyter Book can be thought of as an "
"_opinionated distribution of Sphinx_. This is a short explanation of how "
"Jupyter Book and Sphinx relate to one another."
msgstr ""

msgid "What is Sphinx?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sphinx is [an open-source documentation engine](https://www.sphinx-"
"doc.org/en/master/) that has been popular in the Python community for "
"nearly a decade. Sphinx is based on the "
"[Docutils](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/) core Python package, which "
"provides a data structure for *documents* in Python. Docutils has no "
"concept of multi-page documents, and so Sphinx uses the basic Docutils "
"data structure, and includes multi-page features such as cross-references"
" and citations and multi-pages table of contents."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sphinx primarily uses a markup language called "
"[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) to write "
"documents. This is similar to markdown, though is less-popular and more "
"flexible. In contrast, Jupyter Book uses [MyST Markdown](https://myst-"
"parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which was created to provide the "
"flexibility of rST but for people who wish to write markdown."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sphinx is also highly _extensible_ - developers can write extensions and "
"themes that allow Sphinx to do extra things not baked into the core tool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more information about Sphinx, check out the [ReadTheDocs Sphinx "
"Tutorial](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-"
"with-sphinx.html)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Jupyter Book is a distribution of Sphinx"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Jupyter Book uses Sphinx for almost everything that it does. For example "
"- resolving cross-references, generating HTML or PDFs, reading in source "
"files and Jupyter Notebooks, etc. It accomplishes this via activating a "
"number of _Sphinx Extensions_ that the [Executable Books "
"Team](https://executablebooks.org) has created. These extensions grow "
"Sphinx's capabilities so that it can handle the use-cases of Jupyter "
"Book."
msgstr ""

msgid "An example: MyST Markdown"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's take the case of MyST Markdown. As mentioned, Sphinx cannot read in"
" markdown files by default, but we'd like our users to do so. We can "
"extend Sphinx's functionality by installing and activating a markdown "
"parser. The [MyST Parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) "
"provides a Sphinx extension that allows Sphinx to read in MyST Markdown. "
"By installing this extension, and adding it to my Sphinx project's list "
"of extensions, Sphinx will now automatically read in `.md` files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When Jupyter Book builds a book, it first activates this core set of "
"Jupyter Book-specific Sphinx extensions. It then translates your "
"`_config.yml` into Sphinx's own configuration language, and uses Sphinx's"
" build command to build the book. You can see the Sphinx configuration "
"file that Jupyter Book uses by running the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "How does Jupyter Book differ from Sphinx?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Beyond having a few extensions pre-activated, there are a couple of other"
" ways that Jupyter Book differs from Sphinx."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Table of Contents** - In Sphinx, the structure of the document is "
"determined by _directives_ called `{toctree}`. These are placed along "
"with the content on a page, and are a way for authors to tell Sphinx "
"about the sub-sections that are underneath that page. Jupyter Book "
"instead uses a _single Table of Contents file_ (called `_toc.yml`) to "
"define the structure of the book."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**YAML Configuration** - In Sphinx, all configuration is defined by a "
"Python file called `conf.py`. Jupyter Book instead uses a YAML file, with"
" a few keys that are unique to Jupyter Book (but are translated into "
"Sphinx configuration at build time). See the [`yaml_to_sphinx` "
"function](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-"
"book/blob/421f6198728b21c94726a10b61776fb4cc097d72/jupyter_book/config.py#L177)"
" for details about how Jupyter Book converts its own config into Sphinx "
"config."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**The Command Line Interface** - Finally, Sphinx has a few command line "
"interfaces to control its functionality - the most popular one being "
"`sphinx-build`. Jupyter Book provides its own CLI (`jupyter-book build`) "
"to handle the extra features described above."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to replicate Jupyter Book's functionality in Sphinx"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because most of Jupyter Book's functionality comes from Sphinx "
"extensions, it means that the broader Sphinx community can replicate much"
" of the functionality of Jupyter Book. You might want to do this if you "
"want more control over the build process or need to integrate more "
"complex steps into your build process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here's a short overview of the Sphinx extensions that are activated by "
"Jupyter Book:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**[MyST-NB](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io)** - Functionality for reading"
" in Jupyter Notebooks in Sphinx, as well as executing them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**[MyST Parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io)** - Functionality for"
" parsing CommonMark and MyST Markdown files into Sphinx. This is not "
"explicitly provided, but is activated by MyST-NB."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**[sphinx panels](https://sphinx-panels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** - "
"Provide Sphinx directives for \"Bootstrap Cards\" that are used "
"throughout the Jupyter Book docs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**[Sphinx Book Theme](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/)** - A "
"Sphinx theme that defines the look and feel of Jupyter Book, and its "
"general layout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To understand how Jupyter Book configures Sphinx, you should check out "
"[the `config.py` module](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-"
"book/blob/master/jupyter_book/config.py). For example, [here is the line "
"that defines the default Sphinx "
"configuration](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-"
"book/blob/421f6198728b21c94726a10b61776fb4cc097d72/jupyter_book/config.py#L23)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you'd like to replicate Jupyter Book's functionality in Sphinx, you "
"should create a Sphinx site, and copy over this configuration into your "
"`conf.py` file. When you build your Sphinx site, it should behave very "
"similarly to Jupyter Book."
