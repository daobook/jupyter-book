msgid "Get started with references"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"References allow you to refer to other content in your book or to "
"external content. They allow you to automatically generate links to that "
"content, or to add extra information like *numbers* to the reference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Citations and bibliographies allow you to cite scholarly work and provide"
" bibliographies that allow readers to follow the references."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial covers the basics of setting up **references** as well as "
"**citations and bibliographies** for your book."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more information about citation and reference syntax, see the "
"[`sphinxcontrib-bibtex` documentation](https://sphinxcontrib-"
"bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#roles-and-directives). Note "
"that this documentation is written with rST syntax in mind and you'll "
"need to adapt the directive/role syntax for your Markdown content."

msgid "Prerequisites"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial assumes that you've either created a demo Jupyter Book from"
" [](../start/your-first-book.md), or that you've got your own Jupyter "
"Book to work from."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic structure of a reference"
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross-references in Jupyter Book usually involve two things:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a **label** for something. This is the thing you'll refer to later"
" in your reference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a reference with a **target**. This target is usually the label "
"you created in `#1`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a label"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, we'll create a label. Labels must come just before headers. You "
"can then refer to them elsewhere in your text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To start with, create a new markdown file in your book (or edit a pre-"
"existing one). Add a markdown header with a label like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is how you specify a label called `my-label` that points to the "
"header just below (`## My header`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also reference labels in this way with the following syntax:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Refer to your label"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that you've created a label, you can refer to it from elsewhere. Try "
"adding the following markdown on the same page (or some other page)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now re-build your book's HTML:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should see that your reference has been replaced with a link to the "
"right spot on the page."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a citation"
msgstr ""

msgid "Next, we'll add a *citation*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a bibtex file"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You'll need a [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/) file to store the "
"information for your citations. In this case, we'll create an empty "
"bibtex file and populate it with one reference."
msgstr ""

msgid "Next, configure your book to include this bibtex file, like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will activate the [`sphinxcontrib.bibtex` extension](https"
"://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, note that the default reference style is `label` which shows up "
"as an in-line link in the rendered HTML as [ABC21]; it is [described in "
"detail here](https://sphinxcontrib-"
"bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#referencing-style) along with "
"other styles. You can adjust the reference style in your book's "
"`_config.yml` file like so:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Add your references"
msgstr ""

msgid "Add some references to your BibTex file. Here's an example citation:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See [the BibTex documentation](http://www.bibtex.org/Using/) for "
"information on the BibTex reference style."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add a citation"
msgstr ""

msgid "In your content, add the following syntax to include a citation:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Re-build your book, and it should look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is my nifty citation {cite}`perez2011python`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add multiple citations at once"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now try adding multiple citations at once by separating each one with a "
"comma."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add the following text to your page:"
msgstr ""

msgid "when you build your book, it should look like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here are multiple citations "
"{cite}`perez2011python,holdgraf_rapid_2016,RePEc:the:publsh:1367,caporaso2010qiime`!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Add a bibliography"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, we'll generate a bibliography for our citations. Links to this "
"bibliography will automatically be created when you cite something."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We'll use the `{bibliography}` directive to add one to our book. Add the "
"following to your page:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will generate the bibliography of all citations in your book. See "
"the bibliography below for an example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more information about configuring and using citations and "
"bibliographies, see [](content:references)."
